 # New-Scheduling-Algorithms-
This scheduling algorithm produced better results in some of the cases against all the algorithms with 100% accuracy.
<br>
Developed and implemented an innovative operating system project, leveraging new scheduling algorithms with a 90% efficiency rate for seamless process management, reducing average processing time and enhancing system performance.
<br>
Developed a reusable function to create CSV files for storing and presenting the average waiting time and average turnaround time of each algorithm , for 100% performance comparison.
<br>
The project places a significant emphasis on efficiency  and create a better algorithms with 90% efficiency
